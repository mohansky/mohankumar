description1: "In technical terms, I'm a front-end developer and work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive websites. I prefer static site generators like Hugo and Gatsby, but can also build your website with WordPress if you like. I take a mobile-first approach."
description2: "In plain words, I create that part of a website which is visible and with which you interact. Depending on your requirement and budget, I either work alone or in partnership with copywriters, graphic designers and back-end developers."
