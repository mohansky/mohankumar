description1: "In technical terms, I'm a front-end developer and work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive websites. I prefer static site generators like NextJs and GatsbyJs."
description2: "In plain words, I create that part of a website which is visible and with which you interact. Depending on your requirement and budget, I either work alone or in partner-ship with copywriters, graphic designers and back-end developers. Whichever scenario you choose, you can be sure that your website is top notch in terms of responsiveness, compatibility, performance, accessibility, security and usability."
